I'm a third year Master student from [College of Optical Science and Engineering](http://opt.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Cuifang Kuang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/cfkuang). Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Opto-Electronics Information Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University. My research interests include computational imaging.
You can find my [CV](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf) here.
